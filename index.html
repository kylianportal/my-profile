			<p>So after many competitions I was selected in the French youth team. I do my first international competition at Helsinki in Finland for the EUropean Para Youth Game. It was such a great experience. After that I was selected for my first European championship, and that was so nice, even that I can't do final.</p>

	<h2> What's the ocular albinism ? </h2>
	
		<h3>
			<p>Albinism is an inherited genetic condition that reduces the amount of melanin pigment formed in the skin, hair and/or eyes. Albinism occurs in all racial and ethnic groups throughout the world.</p>
				
			<p>People with albinism have vision problems hat are not correctable with eyeglasses,and many have low vision. It’s the abnormal development of the retina and abnormal patterns of nerve connections between the eye and the brain that cause vision problems. The presence of these eye problems defines the diagnosis of albinism.</p>
			
			<p>
			For my example, I see less than 0.5/10 per eyes with my glassescorrection. I'm in S12 categorie in handisport, I concure with some visually impaired. But albinism is not the only disibilities making visiually imparaired.
